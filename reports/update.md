Your project update should answer the following questions (note that some are the same as in the proposal):

### Project Goals <br>
1) What is the goal of your project; for example, what do you plan to make, and what should it do?  Identify a lower bound you are confident you can achieve and a stretch goal that is more ambitious.
The goal of my project is to create a basic journaling app that allows you to quickly creat files to jot down your thoughts, that all share a common parent file. A lower bound that I am confident to achieve is the ability to create/edit/delete journal entries in whatever form they happen to take shape in.

### Learning Goals <br>
2) What are your learning goals; that is, what do you intend to achieve by working on this project?
My learning goals are really getting good at being able to google and amass information quickly that can be quickly deployed. I also hope to learn how to program basic logical loops for common software. 

### Getting Starting <br>
3) What have you done to get started?  Have you found the resources you need, do you have a plan to find them, or do you need help?  If you found any resources you think I should add to the list on the class web page, please email them to me.
I started my process diagram and have kind of know about how my program should function. I used google to find out what resources I needed like fgets to take input etc.

### First Steps <br>
4) What are you working on now?  Describe at least three concrete tasks that you are working on, and identify which members of the team are working on them.  For each one, what is the "definition of done"; that is, what will you produce to demonstrate that the task is done?
Im working on solidifying what functions I need to complete my planned features.

Audience: Think of your update as a rough draft of your final report.  Target an external audience that wants to know what you did and why.  More specifically, think about students in future versions of SoftSys who might want to work on a related project.  Also think about people who might look at your online portfolio to see what you know, what you can do, and how well you can communicate.
