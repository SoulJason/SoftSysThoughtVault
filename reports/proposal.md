### Project Goals <br>
The goal of my project is to create a journaling application, that's focus is to help manage productive and person thought flow that tracks day by day. A lower bound I am confident I can achieve is adding entries and storing them, while a stretch goal would make it customized more towards my liking on what an journal would be like. (Maybe adding a visual component but not likely, i heard its very difficult we'll see) I want to create something someone may have used during the start of the internet era, and if I was one of the first programmers in C.

### Learning Goals <br>
I want to learn how to create a functional application that can take store and organize data/memory in C (and how it works), mostly through text and specified data entry points like time and date. This is mostly to learn how to use functions and programming to build something tangible, it can be a bit hard to imagine building when you first learn a programming language.

### Getting Starting <br>
I probably will search up what skills/resources people usually need on the internet to build things like this in C and use google as my closest tool. I haven't dived fully into the logistics yet and would like to consult the teaching team if possible. 

### First Steps <br>
1. Research what things about C I'll need to know/use. I'll know when this is done if I can tie my research into building each thing I expect to have completed.
2. Properly manage/estimate my timeline for core features and my stretch goals. This won't be fully concrete, but I guess I will know what exactly I want. 
3. Go through what I need to know with what I already know, and see if its reasonable that I can build this within the time frame.
